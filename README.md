# Workout-Nation

## Description
This is a group project for a coding bootcamp to demonstrate the collective knowledge gained from the class so far and the ability of each contributer to learn independently new skills to enhance the understanding and ability of said project. In this designed app users will be prompted to sign up or log in to begin which will therefore be stored into the database; which can be recalled upon.

## Installation
Here is a quick documentation for deploying an app on Heroku:

Step 1: Type “heroku create” in your local main branch.

Step 1.5: Sometimes it may prompt you to press any key, after which it will redirect you to the login process.

Step 2: Type “git push heroku main” in the command line to push your code to Heroku.

Step 3: Go to Heroku and find your application. Click on it to enter.

Step 4: In the “Resources” dashboard, search for “JawsDB MySQL”.

Step 5: Create an account in Cloudinary by visiting their website at https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free#gsc.tab=0.

Step 6: Your environment variables can be found in the following image.

Step 7: Use the following command line, but replace the values with your own Cloudinary API credentials obtained in Step 6.

heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name

heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key

heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

## Roadmap
Collectively future development of project would have ability for users to add friends and be able to message back and forth. Another addition would be completing achievements and being able to compete with friends on challenges. When users are at their dashboard they would see their progress, completed challenges and their achievements. Future versions would have tutorials for a wider variety of workouts to include but not limited to step-by-step photos or videos. The ability to share recipes, track more physical aspects, along with section for more detailed comments on your workout and a section for future fitness goal planning.

## Contributing
At this time, we are not looking for contributions to the project. We are excited to work together and build something with the knowledge we have gained so far in our journey. As we understand there may be manys ways we can do things simplier or different, we want to show off certain technical knowledge and ability with our code.

## Authors and Acknowledgement
At this time we would to formally introduce the team and break down the acknowledgements of the work each person has presented and gifted this project. First it is always nice to work and develop skills with others, but working with each member has been truly rewarding.  


Patrick Childers (https://github.com/Childy77) - Lead font-end.  I created to initial HTML and CSS template to add to.  I then took what the team developed in the working app and added more styling and format to make it more usable and and functional. 

Andrew (Sheng-Chu) Chou (https://github.com/Andrew-TechMaster) - Lead back-end. Handled most back end code, working along with other members to create a responsive and fucntioning app.

Ashley Arena (https://github.com/aecarena) - Between writing javascript, making sure routes are functioning and correct, assisting with handlebars and formatting, to creating Professional README documenting this extraordinary team and the hard work put into making this fun app.

Chrissy Martin (https://github.com/chrissy-martin) - Swing between front-end and back-end. Worked with and added the code for Passport.js. We are using Passport.js as our new middleware package (that hasn't been discussed in class) to implement authentication and authorization for our app. Worked on a little bit of the styling of the app and created the code for responsive design across different viewing platforms.
